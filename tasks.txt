TASKS:


**check firebase api (looks like we are using two api keys?)
 - i wasn't able to sign in


markers
 - display correct marker information
 - all markers should be on the map upon first load-up (add all markers
   from database onto the map)

login
 - create distinct index.html vs map.html
   -> we can have index.html remove report button; clicking the navbar's
      Hazard > Report Hazard button gives a prompt window asking user to
      sign in first

upvote/downvote
 - a user should only be able to upvote/downvote once, right now they
   can upvote as many times as they like
 - after opening the marker info again, upvotes/downvotes are reset to 0
   until upvoting again, then shows actual changes (I upvote > '1 upvote'
   > close infowindow > open infowindow > '0 upvotes' > I upvote > '2 upvotes'

misc.
 - repo cleanup: all scripts in new .js files in scripts folder
                 all <style> in new .css files in css folder
                 follow commenting style from lecture example
